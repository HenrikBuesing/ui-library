# ui-library docs

Documentation of the components and hooks provided by the package

## Local development

to run the local version of the docs use ``npm run dev:docs``

Before commiting changes to the docs run ``build:docs-uil`` \
this will update the package bundle used by the docs. This way the docs can always use the latest version of the package. 

To clear the docusaurus cache and build dir run 
``npm run clean:docs``
