# Installing the package

Install via npm:

```npm
  npm install @hbuesing/ui-library
```

## Importing the stylesheet
To be able to use the components properly you have to import the required stylesheet.
You can import the stylesheet on the same page where you use a component, or you can import it globally.
It can be imported within your React component or inside another stylesheet file.

```js title="JavaScript import"
import '@hbuesing/ui-library/dist/index.css';
```

```css title="Stylesheet import"
@import '@hbuesing/ui-library/dist/index.css';
```

## Basic usage
```tsx
import React from 'react';
import '@hbuesing/ui-library/dist/index.css';
import {CustomButton} from "@hbuesing/ui-library";

export default function AlertButton() {
  return (
    <div>
      <CustomButton label={'Alert'} onClick={() => alert('Button clicked!')}/>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Customization
Most components can be customized by providing themes or colors to directly influence the component's design. There
are some options that are not directly customizable for a single component. For instance, you can't provide a custom
color for the outline of a focused input component. If you want to change the styling for every component, you can override
the corresponding css variables.

```css title="Overriding the focused outline color"
:root {
--uil-outline-focus: green;
}
```

:::danger[Overriding css variables]
Overriding css variables may cause unexpected component behavior. \
It is not recommended to override them, only do so if it is absolutely necessary.
