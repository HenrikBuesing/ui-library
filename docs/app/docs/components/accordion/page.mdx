# Accordion

The accordion component is used to stack multiple `<Details/>` components.

<DefaultAccordion/>

```tsx
<Accordion>
  <Details>...</Details>
  <Details>...</Details>
  <Details>...</Details>
</Accordion>
```

## Options

The props `icon`, `iconPosition` & `divider` allow you to customize the styling of all details components within the accordion.  
Please refer to the [details documentation](/docs/components/details) to learn more about what each option does.

<AccordionCustom/>

```tsx
<Accordion divider icon={plusIcon} iconPosition={'end'}>
  <Details>...</Details>
  <Details>...</Details>
  <Details>...</Details>
</Accordion>
```

## Expanded state

By default, every detail can be expanded independently.  
Use the `name` prop if only one detail should be open at the same time.

<AccordionSingle/>

```tsx
<Accordion name={'single-select'}>
  <Details>...</Details>
  <Details>...</Details>
  <Details>...</Details>
</Accordion>
```
