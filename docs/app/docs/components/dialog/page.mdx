# Dialog

A dialog component appears on top of the main content. It typically requires user
interaction before allowing them to return to the main content, often used for displaying important information,
asking for user input, or confirming actions.

<DefaultDialog/>

## Content

The content of the dialog can be any valid HTML. The dialog-utility-components offer basic styling 

## Sizes

You can render the dialog in three different sizes: `small`, `medium` and `large`. \
By default, the dialog size will be determined by its content.

<DialogSize size={'small'}/>

## Scrolling

The `scrollable` prop overrides the default behaviour that would normally disable scrolling while the dialog is open.

<DialogScroll/>


## OnCancel Callback

The `onCancel` event will run whenever users close the dialog with the Escape key.

<Callout type={'warning'}>
  The `onCancel` & `disableEscapeKey` props are mutually exclusive.
</Callout>

## DisableEscapeKey

You can prevent users from closing the dialog with the escape key.

<DialogESC/>

## Accessibility 

The `ariaModal`, `describedby` and `labelledby` props can be used to provide additional accessibility information for users. \
If the `ariaModal` prop is provided, the role of the dialog will change from `dialog` to `alertdialog`.

<DialogAlert/>
