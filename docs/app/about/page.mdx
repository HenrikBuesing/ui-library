# About UI-Library

This library comprises a set of reusable UI components designed for React-based applications.  
Originally it was designed for personal projects, but you are welcome to integrate it into your projects as needed.

If you have any suggestions or feedback feel free to open an issue over at [GitHub](https://github.com/HenrikBuesing/ui-library/issues).

## Maintainers

Currently, the project is maintained and developed by Henrik Büsing.

## License

The project is licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/HenrikBuesing/ui-library/main/LICENSE).

## Attribution

Some components use icons developed by the [Font Awesome team](https://fontawesome.com),
which are licensed under the [Font Awesome Free license](https://fontawesome.com/license/free).  
If you haven't already, be sure to check out their extensive collection of high-quality icons.

This package does not rely on Font Awesome's npm packages (e.g., `@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core`) in order
to minimize dependencies. Instead, it incorporates the SVG code of the respective icons.
